# Jayden Billingsley — Personal website starter

This repo contains a minimal, responsive personal site for Jayden Billingsley. It includes:
- index.html — landing page with sections for About, Projects, Links, and Contact
- styles.css — simple modern styles (no frameworks)
- instructions below for customization and deployment

## Quick preview
Open `index.html` in your browser to preview locally.

## Customization checklist
1. Replace placeholder email (hello@jaydenbillingsley.com) with your real contact address or wire up a form service.
2. Add a photo or avatar: place an image in an `img/` folder and insert an `<img>` where you'd like.
3. Update the hero copy, project descriptions, and links.
4. If you'd like to embed SoundCloud players, go to a track or playlist on SoundCloud, click "Share" → "Embed" and paste the iframe into the relevant project card.

## Deploying
Two simple options:

A) GitHub Pages
- Create a repository (e.g., `jaydenbillingsley.github.io`) and push these files to the `main` branch. GitHub Pages will serve it at `https://<your-username>.github.io/`.
- Or push to any repo and enable Pages from `main` branch under repo settings.

B) Netlify / Vercel
- Drag-and-drop the site folder to Netlify, or connect the repo to Netlify/Vercel for continuous deploys.

## Enhancements to consider
- Add a small JS file to load recent posts from Substack via RSS or API.
- Add SoundCloud embeds for specific albums (if you want inline playback).
- Add analytics, sitemap, or Open Graph images for improved sharing.
- Use a static site generator (Eleventy, Hugo) if you want templating and easier content management.

If you want, I can:
- wire up a SoundCloud embed for specific albums if you share their embed URLs,
- add a contact form wired to Formspree or Netlify Forms,
- or convert this to a small React/Vite site or static-site-generator template.
